## Contributing to Development

### Generating Documentation

Documentation is generated using [sphinx][3] and [auto-doc][4]. Please see their respective documents for help. Docs are automatically built for each new release, but you can build them locally by navigating to the `/docs` directory and then issuing the following commands:

    >>> make clean
    >>> make notebooks
    >>> make html

You can then go ahead and navigate to the `/docs/_build/html` directory and open them up by clicking on `index.html`. There is a brief explanation on how to better contribute to docs, which can be found in the README.md file within the docs/ directory!

### Suggestions

If there is a feature you would like to see added, please submit as an [Issue][5].
Feel free to send pull requests if you are comfortable, otherwise another developer will try to reply to any issue requests.

### Running Tests Locally

To run the tests locally:

    python setup.py test

To run the tests locally with coverage:
